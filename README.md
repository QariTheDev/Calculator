# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app built with React.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It includes all the necessary configuration and dependencies to run the app.

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd calculator-app


3. Install the dependencies:
npm install


4. Start the development server:
npm start


5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the Create React App documentation for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. At this point, you have full control over them.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, it's available if you need to customize your project.
